# About BV-Uinte
The Social Platforms have been in great demand from a long time to fulfill the communication gap and quick information transfer. BV-Unite is one such platform designed specially for Bansthalites which allows teachers, alumni and students of Banasthali Vidyapith to share information among them specific to their interest. This website allows all users to create, view and like posts, edit one’s profile and view other’s profile, message other members and gives the advantage to only teachers and alumni of our college to make announcements regarding any important and relevant information.  
It includes all the basic functionalities to give an interactive experience to the users. Hence, this platform can become a single channel for the communication purpose and would cut down the problem of checking of too many platforms for the relevant information or updates and would also help to facilitate the senior-junior interaction. 


# Framework Used..
The Project has been built by using python web framework Django. It provides built-in features for everything including Django Admin Interface, default database – SQLlite3, etc. Default database of Django - SQLite has been used as a Database for developing this Project. SQLite provides an excellent development alternative for applications that are predominantly read-only or require a smaller installation footprint. To develop Frontend, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS and Google fonts have been used.

The middle section is for the Posts, while the right section has another caraousel which gives recent three announcements. From the home page we can upload posts and like/unlike different posts with the help of Like/Unlike button.
